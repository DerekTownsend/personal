        <h2> Views On Teamwork</h2>
            <p> To me team work in most simplified form is a group of people working towards a common goal. I believe that teamwork has its pros and cons. The main con is that it can cause for group memebers to become too reliant on one another causing production and overall efficiency to decline, which bad in any situation. The main pro is that if everyone in the group has a basic enough understanding of the situation then more work will get done.  </p>  
            
        <h2> Views On Leadership</h2>
            <p> A leader in my opinion is a person who has the ability to unite a a group of people and motivate them to work together as efficiently as possibe. A leader guides his group memebers in times of peril. The leader is also the person with the most liability  because a single mistake can cause for even more major problems to occur. To a certain extent that fear of failure cause for them to become better leaders because it makes them more cautious and patient. They either have to rally under the pressure or get crushed by it.  </p>
