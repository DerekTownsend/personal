            <h2> Work Experience</h2>
            <p> The little experience I do have is mostly just following the instructions of my superiors and me carrying thing around. I haven't had a normal job but i was paid for those tasks.</p>
            <h2> Volunteer Experience</h2>
            <p> Some of my voulenteer work consisted of me helping around at the school that my mother works at and the other part is from a charity known as <a href="http://kicksforacure.mytmc.com/faf/home/default.asp?ievent=1136173">Kicks for a Cure</a>. Other than that organization most of my voulenteer work consists of me helpng around at the school that my mother works at. I sometimes help the Kidergarden students learn about new topics, which is very easy.  </p>
